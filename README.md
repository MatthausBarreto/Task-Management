# Task-Management
https://task-mng-app.herokuapp.com/

This app contains full CRUD functionality, user authentication/registration and full integration with a PostgreSQL Database in a cloud server.

I used Django, Postgres, Git and Heroku from 0 to Deploy.

Goal of this app was to develop my understanding on MVT patterns and CRUD, Class Based Views made it a bit easier to track how 
everything works and made the code a lot cleaner than a Function Based Views app(FBV), although I still prefer FBV because it seems
to be more flexible with the requests management.



1- You need to register to be able to use the app, it directly authenticates the user after that.

2- After authenticantion, you should have full access to the app functionalities, You can create your tasks,
you can update your tasks, delete your tasks(whether they're completed or not) and view all of your tasks
with their status in your home page.

3- When you're creating a task, you can give it a title and full details in a text area that's gonna be available.

4- You can update the tasks name/title, details and it's completion status, tasks marked as 'completed' will have a green point to showcase it.

5- The Database can allocate multiple tasks from multiple users, but users are not allowed the see other users tasks.

6- There's a search bar if you want to quickly locate a task.




From this app, it should only be considered for evaluation my Backend Development skills.
